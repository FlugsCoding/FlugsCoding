<h1 align="center"> Hey there, the name's flugsðŸ‘‹ </h1>

I am a young web developer based in the United Kingdom. My prominent skill lies in front-end development, however, I have worked with multiple back-end coding languages and frameworks and continue to do so actively.

Some of the languages/frameworks I have completed projects in consist of:
- Python
- JavaScript
- Laravel
- HTML/CSS
- Django
- And more.

A large majority of my GitHub contributions over time have been on private repositories, and my portfolio is currently not up because I generally haven't needed it. If you would like to view any of my work, contact me via any of the methods provided below.

Here is some basic information about me:

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on a few small-scale web projects. I am not pursuing projects from/with people I do not already work with.
- ðŸŒ± I am not currently learning anything new, however, I am always refreshing my knowledge of the things I know.
