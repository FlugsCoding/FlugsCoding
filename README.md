<h1 align="center"> Hey there, the name's flugs👋 </h1>

I am a young web developer based in the United Kingdom. My prominent skill lies in front-end development, however, I have worked with multiple back-end coding languages and frameworks and continue to do so actively.

Some of the languages/frameworks I have completed projects in consist of:
- Python
- JavaScript
- Laravel
- Django
- And more.

Here is some basic information about me:

- 🔭 I’m currently working on a few small-scale web projects. I am not taking projects from people I do not already work with.
- 🌱 I am not currently learning anything new, however, I am always refreshing my knowledge of the things I know.
